Abstract:
  Objectives: To examine geographic variation, temporal trajectories,
  and equity dimensions of quality in Australian residential aged care
  using the Star Ratings system introduced in late 2022.

  Design: Repeated cross-sectional and longitudinal panel analysis of
  publicly available administrative data, reported in accordance with
  the STROBE guidelines.

  Setting: All rated residential aged care facilities in Australia
  (census of the rated population, not a sample).

  Participants: 3,002 unique facilities observed across 11 quarterly
  Star Ratings extracts (May 2023 to October 2025), yielding 28,708
  facility-quarter records.

  Main outcome measures: Overall Star Rating (1-5 stars) and four
  sub-category ratings (residents' experience, compliance, staffing,
  quality measures). Secondary outcomes: spatial clustering (Global and
  Local Moran's I), quality trajectories by provider type (mixed-effects
  models), and quality desert identification (distance to nearest
  adequately rated facility).

  Results: Mean overall rating improved from 3.38 to 3.87 stars over 11
  quarters, with improvement decelerating over time (quadratic term
  p < 0.001). In random-slopes mixed models, for-profit facilities
  rated 0.10 stars lower than not-for-profit (p < 0.001) and government
  facilities rated 0.43 stars higher (p < 0.001); these associations
  were robust to adjustment for facility size, state, remoteness, and
  area-level disadvantage. For-profit ownership was independently
  associated with persistent low performance (OR 2.75; 95% CI
  1.13-6.70). Quality ratings clustered spatially (Global Moran's I =
  0.24, p < 0.001), with 17 statistically significant low-quality
  clusters identified in Western Australia and South Australia. Eleven
  SA3 areas were classified as quality deserts (>50 km to a 3+ star
  facility), overwhelmingly in remote locations. Area-level
  socioeconomic disadvantage did not predict quality desert status after
  adjusting for remoteness (p = 0.60).

  Conclusions: Australia's Star Ratings system is associated with
  substantial sector-wide quality improvement, but a persistent
  for-profit quality gap and geographic clustering of low quality
  present opportunities for targeted regulatory intervention.
